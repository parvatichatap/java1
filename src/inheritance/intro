- one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object
- "is-a" relationship

Advantages:
1. code re-usability
2. method overriding(runtime polymorphism)

		A   (super/parent class)
	   /|\
	    |
	    B    (sub class/child class)

syntax -
	class A {

	}

	class B extends A

Note:

Multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java thro' class
