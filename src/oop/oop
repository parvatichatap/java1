Object Oriented Programming System(OOPs) Concept
- Smalltalk : 1st truly object oriented language

Object :
- real world entity
- eg. chair,table,laptop,computer,bike,car,birds,Pen etc
- entity has states & behaviours
	State : represents data of an object
	Behaviour : represents the functionality of an object
- instance of a class
- can logical & physical
- can takes up some space
- runtime entity


Class :
- collection of objects
- logical entity
- does not consumes memory
- a template or blueprint from which objects are created

Inheritance :
- when one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object
- provides code re-usability
- to achieve runtime polymorphism

Polymorphism :
- one task is performed in different ways

Abstraction :
- hiding internal details & showing functionality

Encapsulation :
- binding or wrapping code & data together into a single unit


New keyword :
	- to allocate memory at runtime
	-
